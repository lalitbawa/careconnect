## What is Heart Rate Variability?

Heart rate variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between each heartbeat. Unlike heart rate, which tells you how fast your heart is beating, HRV tells you how adaptable your heart is to changing demands.

A healthy heart doesn't beat like a metronome—it speeds up and slows down in response to breathing, movement, stress, and other factors. This variability is actually a sign of good health.

## Why HRV Matters for Elderly Care

For elderly people, HRV is particularly valuable because:

### 1. It Declines Naturally with Age
As we age, HRV typically decreases. But sudden changes from an individual's baseline can indicate health issues.

### 2. It Reflects Overall Health
HRV is influenced by:
- Sleep quality
- Stress levels
- Hydration
- Illness
- Medication effects

### 3. It Can Predict Health Events
Research shows that declining HRV can precede:
- Infections
- Cardiovascular events
- Cognitive changes
- General health decline

## What Do the Numbers Mean?

HRV is typically measured in milliseconds (ms). Here's a general guide:

| HRV Range | What It Might Mean |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Higher than usual | Good recovery, low stress |
| Normal for individual | Baseline health |
| Lower than usual | Possible stress, illness, or fatigue |
| Significantly lower | May warrant attention |

**Important:** What matters most is the trend over time, not a single reading. Everyone's baseline is different.

## How CareConnect AI Uses HRV

Our platform analyses your loved one's HRV patterns to:

1. **Establish their personal baseline** - We learn what's normal for them
2. **Detect deviations** - We spot when readings change significantly
3. **Correlate with other data** - We look at HRV alongside sleep and activity
4. **Provide context** - We explain what changes might mean in plain English

## A Real Example

Margaret, 78, typically has an HRV around 28ms. When it dropped to 18ms for three consecutive days, CareConnect AI alerted her daughter Sarah.

Combined with slightly elevated resting heart rate and reduced activity, Sarah's GP was able to identify and treat a urinary tract infection early—before Margaret even felt unwell.

## What Can Affect HRV?

Several factors can lower HRV temporarily:

- **Poor sleep** - A bad night's rest will show in morning HRV
- **Alcohol** - Even moderate consumption affects HRV
- **Illness** - The body's stress response reduces variability
- **Dehydration** - Common in elderly people
- **Medication changes** - Some drugs affect autonomic function
- **Stress** - Physical or emotional

## Limitations to Understand

While HRV is valuable, it's important to know:

- Consumer wearables estimate HRV; they're not medical-grade
- Single readings are less meaningful than trends
- HRV alone doesn't diagnose conditions
- It should complement, not replace, regular healthcare

## Taking Action on HRV Insights

If CareConnect AI alerts you to HRV changes:

1. **Don't panic** - A single low reading isn't cause for alarm
2. **Look for patterns** - Is it persisting over several days?
3. **Consider context** - Has anything changed recently?
4. **Check other metrics** - How's sleep and activity?
5. **Consult healthcare providers** if concerns persist

## The Bottom Line

HRV is a window into your elderly loved one's autonomic nervous system—and by extension, their overall health. By tracking it passively through their existing wearable, you gain insights that were previously only available in clinical settings.
